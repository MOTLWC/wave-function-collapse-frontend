# Wave Function Collapse

### [Check It Out]((https://wfc-motlwc.netlify.app/))

## Description 

WFC (Wave Function Collapse) aims to combine a CRUD application with the WFC algorithm, aiming to allow users to create and share both, prompts the input bitmaps for generating art, and the art users have generated. Wave Function Collapse is an algorithm that creates larger bitmaps from similarities found in the input bitmaps.

## Features

- Paint canvas for creating prompt bitmaps
- Wave Function Collapse algorithm for getting prompts

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Core programming language for both the front-end and back-end logic.
- **Django**: To interface with the Postgres database 
- **React**: Client side rendering for dynamic updating of elements, without server interaction
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the Rendered pages.

## Limitations

As a solo project with a one-week timeframe, WFC met the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) requirements, but several limitations were identified:

- **UI/UX Design**: The application's design is unfinished, leading to an inconsistent and unattractive user experience. Key components, such as an expandable menu and hyperlink
styling, require significant improvements.

## Future Steps

Moving forward, I plan to address the issues highlighted in the limitations section:
